* ### [Barett](http://barett.wd.bytic.ru) ([github page](https://github.com/Gjils/Barett))
  Barett is my first big project that I made at spring 2023 as the graduate work on the web-design course. During the work, I developed design for a fictional online guitar shop and build it. This project helped me to improve my design skills and learn basics of js and constructions such as sliders and pop-up windows in practice. Also I learned the basics of requests, most of content on site are generated dynamically from json shells.

* ### [Accents](https://gjils.github.io/accentsgame/) ([github page](https://github.com/Gjils/accentsgame))
  
  Accents game is my school project. I've made it to help students like me learn the accents in words to correctly complete one of the taasks in final exam. Doing this project, I've learn how to use closures and fetch API in real cases. Also I tried to make code in this app comply with OOP

* ### [Spelling](https://gjils.github.io/spelling-game/) ([github page](https://github.com/Gjils/spelling-game))
  
  Spelling game is an extention of my previous project. Now you have to choose the correct letter instead the accent. I fully rewrote all code with react
  
  [![Stack](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=figma,react)](https://skillicons.dev)
  
  Advantages:
  
  * Pleasant UI
  
  * You can choose from 4 tasks
  
  * You can see your stats and level. Data is not reset after reloading
   
  * You can switch between dark and light theme and change background color
   
  * The app is adaptated for most screen resolutions
