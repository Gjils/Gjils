* ### [Barett](http://barett.wd.bytic.ru) ([github page](https://github.com/Gjils/Barett))
  Barett is my first big project that I made at spring 2023 as the graduate work on the web-design course. During the work, I developed design for a fictional online guitar shop and build it. This project   helped me improve my design skills and learn basics of native js and constructions such as sliders and pop-up windows in practice. Also I learned the basics of requests, most of content on site are generated dynamically from json shells.
